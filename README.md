# Mesh-Networking-with-NodeMCU-ESP8266-and-painlessMesh
Mesh networking in IoT applications using NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontrollers and the painlessMesh library. Mesh networks allow devices to communicate directly with each other without a central router, enabling self-healing and extended range through multi-hop routing.
